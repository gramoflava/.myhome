# Utility Scripts

This directory contains helper utilities for common repetitive tasks. These scripts are designed with the following principles:

- **Portability**: Maximum compatibility across Linux and macOS with minimal dependencies
- **No external packages**: Scripts avoid external library dependencies when possible
- **Low maintenance**: Designed to work reliably over time without frequent updates
- **Self-contained**: Each utility is standalone and can be used independently

## Utilities

- **automat.py** - Automation utility for repetitive system tasks
- **png2icns.py** - Converts PNG images to macOS .icns icon format
- **rsyncx** - Robust, resumable directory sync over SSH with smart defaults

## Requirements

- Python 3 (for Python scripts)
- zsh (for shell scripts)
- Standard Unix tools (available on both Linux and macOS)

Individual utilities may have specific requirements documented in their help output.
